# CPT-AX_fNIRS_EEG
Continuous performance test CPT-AX modified for the fNIRS measurement 

A series of 48 trials are combined into a 12 minute sequence (without breaks etc.). In each trial, lasting 15 s on average (13-17 s), either a letter A or B is presented first, then after 500 ms it is replaced by either a letter X or Y presented for 12 s, followed by 1500-3500 ms jitter (a fixation dot). There are 12 trials per combination (A-X, A-Y, B-X, B-Y). A 20-s fixation dot precedes the first trial. The task is to count the A-X pairs and report their number at the end.
